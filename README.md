# devbox - my virtual machine provisioning scripts

These files use [Vagrant] to create an instance of a virtual machine
with my preferred software installed on either [VirtualBox] or [AWS].

I publish this repository for **example purposes only**. I do not
recommend using it as-is. Instead, treat it as a source of ideas for
creating your own Vagrant setup.


[Vagrant]: http://www.vagrantup.com/
[VirtualBox]: https://www.virtualbox.org/
[AWS]: http://aws.amazon.com/
